Description: CICTv2 is an R implementation of the method "Causal Inference Using
Compositions of Transactions (CICT)", which infers gene regulatory interactions from
RNA-sequencing data. Regulatory interactions are inferred in three steps, which are
represented by three separate functions in this package. First, a gene-gene association
measure is calcuated for each gene-gene pair (calcualteRawEdges). Second, higher-order
features describing distributions of associations are calcualted for each gene-gene pair.
(prepareEdgeFeatures). Third, a random forest is trained on the matrix containing both the
association measure and higher order features using a ground-truth network, and each
gene-gene pair is assigned a probability of interaction (predictEdges).
