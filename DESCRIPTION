Description: CICTv2 is an R implementation of the method "Causal Inference Using Compositions of Transactions (CICT)",
    which infers gene regulatory interactions from RNA-sequencing data. Regulatory interactions are inferred in three
    steps, which are represented by three separate functions in this package. First, a gene-gene association measure
    is calcuated for each gene-gene pair (calcualteRawEdges). Second, higher-order features describing distributions
    of associations are calcualted for each gene-gene pair (prepareEdgeFeatures). Third, a random forest is trained on
    the matrix containing both the association measure and higher order features using a ground-truth network, and each
    gene-gene pair is assigned a probability of interaction (predictEdges).
